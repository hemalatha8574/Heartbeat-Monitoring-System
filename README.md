# Heartbeat Monitoring System  


# Heartbeat Monitoring System

## 🎯 Objective  
To measure heart rate (BPM) using a pulse sensor and Arduino.

---

## 🛠 Components Required  
- Arduino UNO  
- Pulse Sensor  
- Buzzer + LED  
- Resistors & wires  

---

## 🔌 Circuit Diagram  

Pulse Sensor OUT → A0
Buzzer → D8
LED → D9

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle  
- Pulse sensor detects heartbeat waveform.  
- Arduino measures beats per minute.  
- If BPM too high → buzzer alert.  

---

## 🌍 Applications  
- Patient monitoring.  
- Fitness trackers.  
- Wearable health devices.
